Security Library Demo
=====================

A simple login style demo using encrypted passwords and an encrypted xml config file

With Genero 3.10+ the passwords are hashed using BCRYPT ( Blowfish )

## Structure of folders
* src: Genero source code
* src/forms: Genero screen forms
* src/lib: Genero library source code
* etc:  genero styles / action defaults / schema files / logindemo.db etc
* gas300: gas .xcf files for running the demo via the GAS
* bin: Created a compile time for the runnable object files
* logs: Created a runtime for logging

## Building - Multiple platform
This prject requires Genero Studio 2.50 or greater installed and licensed.

Either use GeneroStudios main UI or build from command line using:
```
gsmake loginDemo320.4pw
```

## Building Extra - Linux / Mac ( assuming gnu make installed )
You build and deploy a GAR file for the application using the makefile
```
$ make gar
$ make deploy
```

With Genero 3.10 you can also build a WAR file and run using JGAS
```
$ make runwar
```

## Running
You can either run from GeneroStudio UI or run from the command line using:
```
$ cd bin320
$ FGLRESOURCEPATH=../etc; fglrun loginDemo.42r
```

On Linux or Mac with gnu make you can just do:
```
$ make run
```

or Run via the Genero Application Server.

The GAS xcf file ( in the GAS300 folder ) has a resource defined of res.path.myhome - this should be edited to point to the base
directory where you have checked out this demo to, ie the expected path for the demo application is: $(res.path.myhome)/loginDemo

Run the deployed GAR file using http://<server>/gas/ua/r/glogindemo

Run the JGAS WAR using http://<server>:8080/loginDemo310/ua/r/logindemo

## Database

### SQLite
The demo comes with an sqlite database in etc/logindemo.db

This is used by default, it comes with one test account, User: test@test.com Password: T3st.T3st

NOTE: SQLite is single user only, if you to deploy this on a server for multiple people to try then use Informix

### Informix
You'll need to change the etc/profile and commend out the driver line for Sqlite and uncomment the informix one. eg:
```
#dbi.default.driver = "dbmsqt3xx"
dbi.default.driver = "dbmifx9x"
```
The studio project sets DBNAME to "logindemo" so you can just create a new empty datebase called logindemo then run the mk_db.42r to create the table.

## Source files
A brief descrption of the source files included in this demo
* crypt.4gl: A simple program to encrypted an xml config file
* gl_lib.4gl: A cut-down version of a generic Genero library
* lib_login.4gl: Login specific library functions used by the loginDemo program
* lib_secure.4gl: The Security Library
* logindemo.4gl: The demo program main source
* logindemo.per: The main screen form for the demo
* login.per: Login screen form
* mk_db.4gl: Program to create the database table 'accounts' used by the demo
* new_acct.per: New account screen form
* schema.inc: Contains the SCHEMA statement for the name of the database

## The etc folder
A brief descrption of the files in the etc folder
* .creds.xml: The encrypted version of creds.xml file
* creds.xml: A simple example creditials XML file
* default.4ad: Genero Action Defaults
* default.4st: Genero Styles
* logindemo.4db: Genero Studio database schema file
* logindemo.db: SQLite demo database

## The Security Library ( lib_secure.4gl )
This is the library that handles all the encryption and security related code. The main public functions are:
* glsec_genPassword: Generate a random password that conforms to a set of rules
* glsec_genSalt: Generate a random salt string
* glsec_genHash: Generate a hash of a password using a salt string
* glsec_fromBase64: Get a string from base64 string or raise an error prompt
* glsec_toBase64: Get base64 version of a string or raise an error prompt
* glsec_getCreds: Retrieve a username/password combination from an encrypted xml config file
* glsec_updCreds: Update creditials in an encrypted XML File

See the code for more details on passed and returned values.
